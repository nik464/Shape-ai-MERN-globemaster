# Shape ai MERN globemaster
 This is a full stack project using MERN and web dev. I have created this for booking hotels and the location is given using API . We also have the option to register and then login. I created this website and contributed by adding three locations (username:kasak_1251) and my friends pratham and riya contributed one location. Some example of tourist places are Nainital which can be seen in campgrounds section. This site can give exact location of trip as seen on a map.
